##	Structure
	These notes are being taken here in plain text as to not be distracted by WP nuances.  The formatting may change over time as I learn more about .md formatting.

	After a HD failure, my progress was deleted without repair.  I'm implimenting version control to have an ease of re-entry if a HD/Data failure happens in the future.  As of this writing, I am/was on lecture 181 and am reviewing the entire course to regain my place.  I don't remember the individual steps taken to simulate progression, so Im just accepting the loss and retaking the course.   I estimate that my time to catch up will be far faster than the time that it took to initially reach that spot, and I can use the overall review.

	I am skipping Section 2: Realistic Landscapes until the landscapes created there are actually needed inside of the course.  There are 4 hours of lectures there that expertely introduce you to the enviornment creation system in UE, but once you complete it you don't return to it at all.  My stoppiing point was in Section 18, and the learnings covered in Section 2 were not touched once Section 3 was started.   I will review it once we are prompted to return to it and will notate it.

The course notes here, and the git commits, -should- match up by #.  I make myself no promises to keep it aligned, but I will strive to do so.

### Section 2:9. Assets now under FAB

 

It seems that FAB replaces the marketplace, as Bridge is still working.   Will update as warranted.
